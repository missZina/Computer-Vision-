Systems deal with high variety and volume of data, specifically images or videos.It is represented as bits and blobs which is hard to explain to a machine.As a result, these systems need intricate techniques to make sense of the data and then make data driven decisions.
Multiple ways of dealing with computer vision challenges. The most popular approach is based on identifying the objects present in an image, object detection. But what if we want to dive deeper? What if just detecting objects isn’t enough –  How we can  analyze our image at a much more granular level?
